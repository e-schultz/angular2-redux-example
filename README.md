# Angular 2/TypeScript/Redux/Webpack Starter

This is the initial version of our starter project using Angular 2.x, Redux, TypeScript and Webpack to tie it all together.

## npm scripts

> To see all available scripts:
```bash
$ npm run
```

### Dev
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This runs a development mode server with live reload etc.

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Production

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This runs a production-ready express server that serves up a bundled and
minified version of the client.

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.


## Example Application

This is a basic application showing a counter, a simple todo list, and session management using Angular 2 + Redux + ng2-redux. 
You can login to the application with:

*username:* user
*password:* pass

This is a sample application to accompany a blog-post on rangle.io, and is a more complete version of the aplication demonstrated in the post.
